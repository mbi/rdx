## Community and Support

The development and improvement of RDX are significantly driven by community feedback. I invite our users to contribute ideas, report issues, or just share their experiences. Your input helps us make RDX better for everyone.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **VPN Issue**: Some users may encounter a blank page due to their browser's CORS policy or because they use a VPN. I recommend using a browser add-on to disable CORS for RDX, or adjusting browser privacy settings to mitigate this issue.
- **Privacy and Tracking**: RDX respects user privacy and operates with minimal tracking(Cloudflare anonymous analytics). If you encounter issues related to aggressive privacy settings in your browser, consider adjusting them or consult the browser's console for more information.
